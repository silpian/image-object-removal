# image-object-removal

repeatedly calculate n derivatives of rgb of pixels
like with maclaurin series and prioritized by distance to current pixel

calculate error rate, against actual background

overlay done with Tkinter

stage 1 (square overlayed onto solid color background)
1. bounds for square
2. iteratively calculate expected rgb from surrounding pixels

stage 2 (square on gradient background)
1.
2.
3. average with calculated rgb from other side

stage 3 (square on "floor" image background)
1.
2.
3.

stage 4 (square on "flower pattern" image background)
1
2.
3.
